# ðŸ§  Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Neural Network 

This project is a minimal OCR system that recognizes hand-drawn digits using a simple neural network trained entirely in-browser with a Python backend â€” inspired by the *500 Lines or Less* book by AOSA.

## âœ¨ Features

- Draw digits (0â€“9) in the browser
- Train the model using your own labeled samples
- Predict drawn digits in real-time
- Neural network from scratch â€” no ML libraries!
- Lightweight HTTP server using Python's built-in `http.server`
